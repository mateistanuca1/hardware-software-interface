# Task: Fixing the Entry Point

Access the directory `tasks/entry-fix-2/support/`.
Run the `make` command, interpret the encountered error, and resolve it by editing the `hello.c` file.

**Checker**: To test the implementation, enter the tests/ directory and run:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

In case of a correct solution, you will get this output:

```
./run_all_tests.sh 

test_EntryFix2                   ........................ passed ...  100

```
