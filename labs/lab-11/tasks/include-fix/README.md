# Task: Warning (not an Error)

Access the directory `tasks/include-fix/support/`.
Run the `make` command.
A warning appears, but it is from the preprocessing/compilation process.
Resolve this warning by editing the `hello.c` file.

**Bonus**: Fix the warning without using the `#include` directive.

**Checker**: To test the implementation, enter the tests/ directory and run:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

In case of a correct solution, you will get this output:

```
./run_all_tests.sh 

test_warning                     ........................ passed ...  100

```
