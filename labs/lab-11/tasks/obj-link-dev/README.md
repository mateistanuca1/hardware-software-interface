# Task: Linking an Object File (without Source Code)

Access the directory `tasks/obj-link-dev/support/`.
The file `shop.o` exposes an interface (functions and variables) that allows displaying messages.
Edit the `main.c` file to properly call the exposed interface and display the messages:

```bash
price is 21
quantity is 42
```

Explore the interface and the content of the functions in the `shop.o` file using `nm` and `objdump`.


**Checker**: To test the implementation, enter the tests/ directory and run:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

In case of a correct solution, you will get this output:

```
./run_all_tests.sh 

test_linking-object-file         ........................ passed ...  100

```
