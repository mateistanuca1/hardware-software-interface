# Task: Using Symbols (Variables and Functions)

Access the directory `tasks/10-var-func-fix/support/`.
Run the `make` command, run the resulted executable, interpret the encountered error, and resolve it by editing the source files.


**Checker**: To test the implementation, enter the tests/ directory and run:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

In case of a correct solution, you will get this output:

```
./run_all_tests.sh 

test_var-func-fix                ........................ passed ...  100

========================================================================

Total:                                                             100/100
```
